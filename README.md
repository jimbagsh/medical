This website was created to help non-native English-speaking healthcare professionals improve their Medical English fluency.

It's main audience are doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals in Mongolia. Key terminology has been translated (by Google Translate) into Mongolian, Russian and Kazakh.

It is divided into three sections that can be studied independently or concurrently.

### Anatomy & Physiology
The AP section is not intended to 'teach' anatomy and physiology. Instead it is using the rearders previous knowledge in those subject areas to improve their understanding of medical English terminology, especially that used in relationship to anatomy and physiology. This section should also help improve reading comprehension of medical literature.

The source for the materials is a textbook called "Etext of Human Anatomy and Physiology" by [Dr. Bruce Forciea](https://www.drbruceforciea.com/a-p.html) which was licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (2012)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). The material and grammar has been made easier but still helps the viewer learn new medical English terms in the context of medical information.

### Medical Terminology
The MT section is intended to help readers understand the building blocks used to make medical terminology. It generally follows the outline of the AP section but can be studied separately.

### Doctor-Patient Conversations
The DP section helps improve conversational skills using conversations between medical professionals and their patients.
