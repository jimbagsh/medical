			<p>Welcome to Medical Terminology for Non-native English Speakers. This online textbook was created to help non-native English healthcare professionals, like doctors, nurses and dentists, to improve their medical English.</p>
			
			<p>This book is adapted from the Introduction to Human Body Systems and Related Medical Terminology by Kurt Rutter who adapted it from the OpenStax textbook Anatomy & Physiology. Both are available free for download from</p>
			
			<p><ul>

			</ul></p> 
			
			<p>I would like to thank Kurt Rutter and the folks who worked on Anatomy & Physiology for allowing free and open access to their texts.</p>
			
			<p>The focus of this online textbook is to help non-native English-speaking healthcare professionals understand and learn medical terminology to better help them access the vast store of medical information published in English. The order of the material has been changed so it more closely matches the other sections of this site.</p>

      		<div class="panel-body">
      		<p>In every lesson, you will see words 'highlighted' like this <a href="mp3/word.mp3" class="sm2_lin"><mark>word</mark></a>. If you click the word, then your device will say the word or phrase. Go ahead and try it!</p>
			<p>At the end of every lesson, you will also find a Glossary of the new words from the lesson, complete with definition and if you click the 'play' button next to the word, you can hear the word out loud. The other tabs give the English-to-Mongolian, English-to-Russian, English-to-Kazakh, and English-to-Thai translations.</p>
