			<p>Welcome to Doctor-Patient Conversations. These conversations are intended to help non-native English healthcare professionals, like doctors, nurses and dentists, to improve their medical English.</p>
			
			<p>Many of the conversations have been adapted from Dr Molly's Medical Spanish Podcast who generously gave permission to use the English translations.</p>
			 
			<p>The level of English is somewhat easier than in the other two sections of the website, Medical Terminology and Anatomy & Physiology, because to help patients understand medical issues, medical terminology and detailed explanations of anatomy and physiology are replaced with generic terms and concepts anyone should understand. But sometimes even patients need to learn more technical medical words to better understand and manage their health. The order of the conversations roughly matches that of the other two sections of this website.</p>
			
			<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
			
			<p>Medicine is an ever-changing field. The author of Medical Terminology for Non-Native English Speakers has made every effort to provide information that is accurate and complete as of the date of publication.

      		<div class="panel-body">
      		<p>In every conversation, you might see words 'highlighted' like this <a href="mp3/word.mp3" class="sm2_lin"><mark>word</mark></a>. If you click the word, then your computer or device will say the word or phrase. Go ahead and try it!</p>
			<p>At the end of every lesson, you will also find a Glossary of the new words from the conversation, complete with definition and if you click the 'play' button next to the word, you can hear the word out loud. The other tabs give the English-to-Mongolian, English-to-Russian, English-to-Kazakh, and English-to-Thai translations.</p>

			<p>We try to bridge the gap between the medical knowledge doctors and nurses already have with the English they need to know better.</p>

			<p><b>Our goal</b> is to help doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who want to improve their medical English by using online textbooks, medical terminology lessons, and doctor-patient conversations.</p>

			<p><br><h3>About the Author</h3></p>

			<p>Jim Damico is an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) Instructor who has taught in Mongolia and Thailand. His main English website is Anglihel.com. Jim Damico is a trained Physical Therapist Assistant and worked in an acute-care hospital for over 10 years where his specialty was wound care and prosthetics. His first educational position was teaching adult English in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. He would go on to join the US Peace Corps as an EFL Teacher Trainer in Thailand. Later, he rejoined the Peace Corps as a TEFL Teacher Trainer in Dalanzadgad, Omnogovi where he worked in the Education & Cultural Department.</p>

			<p>It was his first work in Ulaanbaatar that exposed him to the need for English courses for Mongolian medical students. And he dedicates this book to those students.</p>

			<p><br><h3>Forward</h3></p>

			<blockquote>
			<p>For many, <i>Doctor-Patient Conversations</i> will be very helpful because they will take 'medical terminology' and 'anatomy & physiology' out of the lessons and into the real world of doctor-patient interactions. I really hope you find these conversations helpful in your study of medical English.</p>
			
			<p>The aim of this site is to help you learn "medical" English in a familiar context, your previous studies in medical school. Interested readers will include all healthcare professionals such as doctors, surgeons, nurses, therapists.</p>

			<p>This website includes English audio (to improve listening and pronunciation), translations (including Mongolian, Russian, Kazakh, and Thai) and links to help readers along.</p>

			<p>I hope you enjoy this material as much as Iâ€™ve enjoyed developing it.</p> 

			<p>Sincerely,</p>

			<p><i><b><span class="large">Jim Damico</span></b></i></p>
