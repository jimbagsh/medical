			<p>Welcome to Anatomy and Physiology for Non-native English Speakers. This online textbook was created to help non-native English healthcare professionals, like doctors, nurses and dentists, to improve their medical English.</p>
			<p>The source for the materials is a textbook called "Etext of Human Anatomy and Physiology" by <a href="https://www.drbruceforciea.com/a-p.html" target="_blank">Dr. Bruce Forciea</a> which was licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a> (2012). The material and grammar has been made easier but still helps the viewer learn new medical English terms in the context of medical information.</p>

      		<div class="panel-heading"><h3>How to Use these Lessons</h3></div>
      		<div class="panel-body">
      		<p>In every lesson, you will see words 'highlighted' like this <a href="mp3/word.mp3" class="sm2_lin"><mark>word</mark></a>. If you click the word, then your device will say the word or phrase. Go ahead and try it!</p>
			<p>At the end of every lesson, you will also find a Glossary of the new words from the lesson, complete with definition and if you click the 'play' button next to the word, you can hear the word out loud. The other tabs give the English-to-Mongolian, English-to-Russian, English-to-Kazakh, and English-to-Thai translations.</p>

			<p>We try to bridge the gap between the medical knowledge doctors and nurses already have with the English they need to know better.</p>

			<p><b>Our goal</b> is to help doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who want to improve their medical English by using online textbooks, medical terminology lessons, and doctor-patient conversations.</p>

			<p>Jim Damico is an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) Instructor who has taught in Mongolia and Thailand. His main English website is Anglihel.com. Jim Damico is a trained Physical Therapist Assistant and worked in an acute-care hospital for over 10 years where his specialty was wound care and prosthetics.

Later, he rejoined the Peace Corps as a TEFL Teacher Trainer in Dalanzadgad, Omnogovi where he worked in the Education & Cultural Department.</p>
